# Project Overview

# Logger Platform

Logger is a unified, scalable log intelligence platform for developers and teams. It provides centralized log collection, monitoring, alerting, and real-time notifications across web and mobile interfaces. The system is built for high performance, security, and extensibility, following Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Clean Architecture principles.

# Global Color Palette

## Minimal Elegant Palette

| Name            | Hex     | Usage                      |
| --------------- | ------- | -------------------------- |
| Primary         | #64748b | Buttons, links, highlights |
| Background      | #f8fafc | App backgrounds            |
| Surface         | #ffffff | Panels, cards, modals      |
| Dark Background | #111827 | Dark mode backgrounds      |
| Dark surface    | #1f2937 | Dark mode panels, cards    |

Use only these core colors for a clean, elegant, and minimal look. Avoid excessive use of accent or alert colors; use subtle shades for status indicators if needed.
